For a long time I couldn't bear the thought of writing a blog post about something technical. In fact, I was afraid of even just sharing a thought or an opinion on any topic in general. I wouldn't tweet, I wouldn't post on instagram, and it's why there aren't that many tech posts on this blog at all

It turns out for a very long time I've just been terrified of getting things wrong, and by extension what that would lead people to think of me. And sharing thoughts with other people, especially on complex topics where there is no black and white answer, is a sure fire way to possibly be wrong in every single way

It's funny. My whole life people would tell me that getting things wrong was part of the process. And I would even pass that on in the advice I gave to others. But I never viscerally understood that in myself. My mantra has always been "if at first you don't succeed, hide the evidence"

Anyway. As a result of recent events in my life, things have changed. And more importantly, I'm ready for them to continue to change. So a part of that is I want to start sharing more. Putting myself out there. My learnings. My frustrations. For better or for worse.
