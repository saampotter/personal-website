One thing that annoys me about the crypto space is that the engineers do too much marketing.

Invariably, this leads to overly complex explanations of things that are often quite simple.

NFT's are one of those such things. So I wanted to have a go at explaining them myself.

Personally, I think they're quite simple and are fundamentally nothing new.
All they are is the eventual evolution of something we do everyday with physical assets, brought to the digital space.

**So if any of your friends, your family, or your colleagues ask what an NFT is, say this:**

You and I can buy identical iPhones from Apple. But while they are the exact same thing, you own the one you bought, and I own the one I bought.
And we can prove that ownership because of things like receipts, bank statements, and a legal system to back it all up.

Now suppose we try this with a digital asset like an image. What you will quickly realise is verifying ownership of that image is really difficult.
Because once you upload it somewhere on the internet, it becomes easy to lose things like where the image originated from,
or whether or not it was downloaded and reuploaded by someone else. Maybe the first person to upload it to their website ended up deleting it.

To solve this, some clever people thought what if we uploaded that image, with your name next to it, to some sort of public bulletin board.
In that way, everyone would be able to see what you uploaded, when, and the fact that you uploaded it. Therefore meaning anyone would be able
to verify your ownership of that image.

Great in theory, but incredibly difficult to implement in practice. Because who runs the bulletin board? How can we trust them not to tamper with
anything?

Eventually we solved those problems by putting everyone in control of the bulletin board, and made tampering with it so expensive that
it's not worth it. And we also call it a blockchain now instead.

That is literally all an NFT is. Your name, and some digital file on a big board that everyone can see and nobody can take down.

So what's the benefit with doing that? Well, it's very similar to any upgrade from pen and paper to digital. It's faster,
it's cheaper, and it's a whole lot more secure.

Because say one day Greg comes along and wants to own that image, all that has to be done to transfer that ownership is have you post on
that same bulletin board: "I'm transfering ownership to Greg".

And forever from that point, everyone will be able to see that you uploaded it first, and then sent it to Greg later on
(hopefully for some profit - because we're all greedy).

So while you can copy and paste that image as much as you like, or buy as many identical iPhones from Apple as you can afford.
You will own yours, and I will own mine. And that proof of ownership will last forever.

Thats the entire post.

Note for the technical people who already know what an NFT is and how they work: please remember this is a simplification for the purpose
of understanding. Skipping the finer details is often necessary.
